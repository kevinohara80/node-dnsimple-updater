# Node DNSimple Updater

Similar to a DynDNS updater, this updater works to update a domain in DNSimple with your current IP

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to a machine on your network
2. Re-name `config.json.example` to `config.json`
3. Edit the settings in `config.json` accordingly.
4. Run `update.js` from the command line or set it up on a schedule via crontab or similar

Enjoy!
